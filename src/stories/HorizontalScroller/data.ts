Alice seems ready to put it all behind her, especially the painful memory of the genie she fell in love with and lost forever -- the handsome and mysterious Cyrus . But deep down Alice knows this world is real, and just in the nick of time the sardonic Knave of Hearts and the irrepressible White Rabbit arrive to save her from a doomed fate.

Joining McGarrett is Detective Danny \"Danno\" Williams, a relocated ex-New Jersey cop - a working man in paradise who prefers skyscrapers to the coastline - but who's committed to keeping the Islands safe for his young daughter; Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-Honolulu police detective and former protégé of McGarrett's father who was wrongly accused of corruption; Dr. Max Bergman, the quirky coroner; Chin's cousin, Kono Kalakaua, a beautiful and fearless native; and Captain Lou Grover, who formerly headed Hawaii's SWAT unit. Joining them is Jerry Ortega, a former classmate of Chin's and the Island's local conspiracy theorist.

An 8-year-old American boy wakes up alone in a rice paddy in a rural Chinese province with no idea how he got there. Details start to emerge when the boy, who calls himself Jacob, recalls that his hometown is Arcadia, and an Immigration agent, J. Martin Bellamy, takes him there. The home he claims as his own is occupied by a 60-year-old couple, Henry and Lucille Langston, who lost their son, Jacob, more than 30 years ago. While they look different, young Jacob recognizes them as his parents. Lucille is overjoyed at the seeming miracle of her son's reappearance. Henry is reluctant to accept that Jacob is back. Those closest to the family want answers, including Sheriff Fred Langston, whose wife Barbara drowned 30 years ago while trying to save Jacob, and Fred's daughter, Maggie, a local doctor. Pastor Tom Hale seeks a spiritual reason for what's happening in his community. When things take an even more shocking turn, Maggie's life-long friend, Elaine Richards, finds herself drawn into Arcadia's growing mystery. Bellamy, an outsider in the town, joins forces with Maggie to figure out why the unexplainable is happening in Arcadia. As their investigation plays out, Maggie learns some unsettling truths about her own past. Will they be able to solve the mystery of Arcadia before the rest of the world catches on to events there? And will they be able to protect Jacob from forces beyond their control?</p>",

Pooling their extensive technological knowledge to solve mind-boggling predicaments amazes federal agent Cabe Gallo, who shares a harrowing history with O'Brien. However, while this socially awkward group is comfortable with each other's humor and quirks, life outside their circle confounds them, so they rely on Paige Dineen, who has a young, gifted son, to translate the world for them. At last, these nerdy masterminds have found the perfect job: a place where they can apply their exceptional brainpower to solve the nation's crises, while also helping each other learn how to fit in.</p>",
